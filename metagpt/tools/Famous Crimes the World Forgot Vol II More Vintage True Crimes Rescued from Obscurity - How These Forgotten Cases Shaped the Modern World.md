Morrow is a historian and a researcher who has spent years digging through old newspapers, archives, and court records to uncover the details of these obscure crimes. He presents each case in a narrative style that transports the reader to the time and place of the crime, while also providing historical and social context. He also analyzes the evidence, the suspects, the motives, and the outcomes of each case, highlighting the flaws and biases of the justice system at the time.
 
Some of the cases featured in this book include:
 
- The murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers, a beautiful cigar girl whose death inspired Edgar Allan Poe's *The Mystery of Marie RogÃªt*.
- The assassination of William Goebel, a controversial politician who was shot on his way to be sworn in as the governor of Kentucky.
- The poisoning of Dr. William K. Dean, a prominent dentist who was killed by his wife and her lover in a sensational trial that involved hypnotism and adultery.
- The kidnapping of Charley Ross, a four-year-old boy who was abducted by two men who demanded a ransom from his wealthy father.
- The slaying of Jennie Bosschieter, a young factory worker who was drugged and raped by four men in a carriage and then dumped in a canal.

Famous Crimes the World Forgot Vol II is a fascinating and well-written book that will appeal to anyone who loves true crime stories. Morrow does an excellent job of bringing these forgotten cases to life and showing how they reflect the society and culture of their times. He also raises some interesting questions about the nature of crime, justice, and memory. This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys history, mystery, and suspense.
  
One of the most interesting aspects of this book is how Morrow compares and contrasts the different methods and techniques used by the investigators and the media in solving and reporting these crimes. He shows how some of the cases were solved by using forensic science, such as fingerprinting, ballistics, and toxicology, while others relied on circumstantial evidence, confessions, or eyewitness testimony. He also shows how some of the cases were sensationalized by the press, who often exaggerated or distorted the facts to attract more readers and influence public opinion.
 
Another intriguing aspect of this book is how Morrow explores the psychological and emotional impact of these crimes on the victims, the perpetrators, and the society. He reveals how some of the crimes were motivated by greed, jealousy, revenge, or lust, while others were seemingly random or inexplicable. He also reveals how some of the crimes sparked outrage, fear, or sympathy among the public, while others were quickly forgotten or ignored. He also examines how some of the crimes affected the lives and careers of those involved, such as the lawyers, the judges, the witnesses, and the journalists.
